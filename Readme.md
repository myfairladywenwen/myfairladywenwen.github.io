1.	What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
The most challenging part would be write a website from scratch, especially the navigation bar.  I tried many ways to realize the feature.  I have no html/css experience before and they are not too hard to understand, however, it takes time to be familiar with them and know where/how to use them to achieve the style I want.  In all I spent more than 25 hours on this assignment.
2.	What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
Use bootstrap implemented classes for easy implementation.  Utilize grid and flex to achieve styling result. And also, use @media, padding, margin and some other features to assist better display.
3.	What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?
Consistency: colors, icons and layout of different pages are consistent.
Font and color pairings: makes the website simple and modern.
	I was first stuck by the navigation bar, especially on how to make it fit for mobile display, but after three attempts and also with the TA’s help, I finally made it.  And this made me kind of proud of my progress.
4.	Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
Add a search bar;
Using some Javascript to implement some dynamic features;
Some content can to compacted into one page and we can have some more other pages.
5.	How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
25 hours.
